## About The Project




### Built With
* Love, Sweat, and Tears


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Getting started with this repo starts by you clicking around and looking at what I've `git push`'d to github starting 1/1/2023



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

I don't know how one could really `use` this as it is just a collection of my thoughts and things that I've worked on during the year but if you find any of it helpful/useful in any way, please give me a follow on `LinkedIn` or something!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

I haven't completely decided what this repos `RoadMap` is going to look like but for today's quick thoughts, this is what I'm thinking as far as repo organization:
1. LeetCode related grinding
2. Notes on topics that I've studied up on
3. Folder dedicated to helping a buddy **#breakIntoTech**
4. Other random `diary style` content
